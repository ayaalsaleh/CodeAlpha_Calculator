# CodeAlpha - JavaScript Calculator

This project is a fully functional, interactive calculator built as **Task 2** for the CodeAlpha frontend development internship. It demonstrates core skills in HTML for structure, CSS for modern styling, and JavaScript for handling all logic and user interactions.
## Features

- **All Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports Addition (+), Subtraction (−), Multiplication (×), and Division (÷).
- **Interactive Interface:** A clean, modern "neumorphic" design that provides tactile feedback when buttons are pressed.
- **Dynamic Display:** The screen shows both the previous operation and the current number, updating in real-time.
- **Error Handling:** Prevents common errors like adding multiple decimal points.
- **Full Functionality:** Includes "All Clear" (AC) and "Delete" (DEL) buttons for easy corrections.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is centered and works well on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the calculator grid, display, and buttons.
- **CSS3:** For the advanced "neumorphic" styling, layout with CSS Grid, and interactive button-press effects.
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** For all the core logic, including:
  - Event handling for all button clicks.
  - A `Calculator` class to manage state (current operand, previous operand, operation).
  - Functions for computation, display updates, and number formatting.

2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3.  Use your mouse to click the buttons and perform calculations.

This project was a fantastic exercise in DOM manipulation and object-oriented JavaScript principles.
